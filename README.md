# TemaAd Algorithm

## Overview

This project demonstrates an algorithm to partition a shelf of books among three employees such that the workload is balanced. The goal is to minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum loads assigned to the employees.

## Files

- `main.c`: Contains the main function and initiates the partitioning process.
- `README.md`: Provides instructions for compiling and running the code.
- `TESTDATASET.c`: Contains the main function and the automatic generated books.

## Compilation Instructions

To compile the code, you need a C compiler such as `gcc`. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code files.
3. Run the following command to compile the code:
`gcc main.c -o TemaAd.exe`

This will generate an executable file named `TemaAd.exe`.

## Running the Program

After compiling the code, run the executable with the following command:
`TemaAd.exe`

The program will print the partitioning of books for the example datasets included in the `main.c` file. You can modify `main.c` to include additional datasets as needed.

## Code Quality

The code is well-organized into modules with clear interfaces. It follows good practices such as:
- Proper indentation and naming conventions.
- Comprehensive comments to explain the code.
- Clear separation of functionality into different files.
